# worthIt


## Description

- Motivation for development - There has been alot of of buzz around the concept of a gig economy. With companies like Grubhub Uber Eats, Door Dash, insticart, and others there are numerous ways to work on your own time and not be limited to the traditional 9 - 5 job. With this freedom however comes some considerations. our project focuses on arguably one of the most important, how much do you stand to make after personal costs. Each delivery app gives the user a narrow window to decide wheather or not to accept or decline a delivery request. The driver is shown what they will be paid for the delivery, what needs to be delivered, and where. This gives them part of picture but not the whole thing. WorthIt aims to change this. 

- Why we built this - A group member has a relative currently using one of these applications to generate income. One of the issues they brought up was the number of deliveries that get posted up that are not worth accepting. In some cases accepting and completing the delivery actually costs the driver money. This sparked the idea for this application. We wanted to create something that would make life easier for people working in this part of the gig economy.

- What problem does it solve - Our application makes it fast and easy for a delivery driver to determine what a driver actually stand to gain from accepting a delivery request from an app based service. Delivery apps like GrubHub, Postmates, Uber eats, or insticart tell the delivery drivers what they will be directly compensated for their work but the app has no way of telling the driver what the actual net profit is for the drivers efforts. With gas becoming increasingly expesnsive some deliveries may not be worth the dirvers time, or in some cases the driver make loose money. WorthIt provides a way for the driver to enter set paramaters like there vehicles mpg, the approximate cost for gas, and what they would like to make hourly. with this information stored the user is then able to enter information about the delivery request. WorthIt crunches the numbers and quickly tells the user if the delivery request is worth accepting or passing on.

- What we learned - While building this we learned how to effectively leverage a Mongo database, How to build a frontend framework using React, and how to utilize JSON Web Tokens or JWTs.
